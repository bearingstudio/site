                    <p class="cay-body">The first-generation Cayenne was a provocation — a car that challenged every assumption about what Porsche was and what it was allowed to be. Critics called it a betrayal. Purists threatened to never buy another Porsche. And yet, the Cayenne saved the company, funded the 911, and became one of the most consequential vehicles in automotive history.</p>
                    <p class="cay-body">This publication isn't about the Cayenne as a business decision. It's about what the Cayenne reveals when you look at it through the lens of design empathy — the practice of designing not just for who your customer is today, but for who they're becoming.</p>

                <div class="cay-feature-right">
                    <p class="cay-body">Design empathy is the discipline of understanding users so deeply that you can anticipate needs they haven't yet articulated. It goes beyond user research and personas — it requires designers to internalize the emotional, social, and aspirational context of the people they're designing for.</p>
                    <p class="cay-body">In the context of the Cayenne, Porsche's design team had to reconcile a fundamental tension: their existing customers bought Porsches because of what they represented — precision, performance, exclusivity. The Cayenne would attract a new kind of customer. The question was whether those two identities could coexist in a single vehicle.</p>
                    <p class="cay-body">They could. And they did. But it required a level of design empathy that the automotive industry had rarely seen before.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="cay-interview-body">

                <div class="cay-qa">
                    <p class="cay-question">The Cayenne is often cited as a turning point in how automotive manufacturers think about customer evolution. From your perspective as an engineer, what does that actually mean in practice?</p>
                    <p class="cay-answer">It means you're designing for a person who doesn't fully exist yet. When Porsche was developing the Cayenne, their core customer was the sports car driver — someone who valued feel, responsiveness, the connection between driver and machine. But they were also designing for that person's life ten years later, when they might have kids, a dog, a different set of priorities. The Cayenne had to carry both of those people at once.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cay-qa">
                    <p class="cay-question">How does that translate to what you're doing at Rivian now?</p>
                    <p class="cay-answer">The parallel is striking. At Rivian, we're designing powertrains for a customer who's making a values-driven purchase — they care about the environment, they want adventure, they're early adopters by nature. But we're also designing for someone who's never owned an electric vehicle, who has range anxiety, who's not sure this technology is ready for their life yet. You have to design for both of those people simultaneously. That's design empathy at the engineering level.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cay-qa">
                    <p class="cay-question">The Cayenne took a lot of criticism when it launched. There's a version of that story where Porsche listened too much to their existing customers and never built it. What does that tell us?</p>
                    <p class="cay-answer">It tells us that design empathy isn't the same as customer service. If Porsche had only listened to who was already in the room, the Cayenne never gets built. Design empathy means understanding what people need, not just what they say they want. Sometimes those are very different things. The Cayenne existed in the gap between what Porsche's customers said they wanted and what their lives were actually asking for.</p>

                    <p class="cay-body">The first-generation Cayenne is ugly, in the way that honest things sometimes are. It doesn't have the elegance of a 911 or the pure aggression of a GT car. It looks like a compromise. But it was something more interesting than beautiful — it was correct.</p>
                    <p class="cay-body">It was correct because it understood its customer better than its customer understood themselves. That's the highest form of design empathy. And it's a lesson the industry is still learning, twenty years later, as every major manufacturer scrambles to build an electric SUV for a customer whose needs they're still trying to understand.</p>
